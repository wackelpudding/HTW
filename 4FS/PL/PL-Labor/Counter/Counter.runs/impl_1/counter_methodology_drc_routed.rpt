2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks direction and clock are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks direction] -to [get_clocks clock]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks reset and clock are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks reset] -to [get_clocks clock]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks direction and clock are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks direction] -to [get_clocks clock]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks reset and clock are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks reset] -to [get_clocks clock]
Related violations: <none>
